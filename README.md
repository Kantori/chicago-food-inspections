# chicago-food-inspections
An analysis of the restaurants in Chicago that have violated health/food inspection standards

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the restaurants' health inspection ratings in Chicago, so that consumers may be better informed of their choices. Furthermore, consumers may suffer from specific health problems, such as allergies and intolerances, and would appreciate knowing the health inspection rating of certain restaurants to make a better choice.
